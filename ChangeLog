Version 0.0.1 (2011 Oct 4) first informal release of package

Version 0.0.2 (2011 Oct 6)
	Changed name of update.snpdata.coding() function to align.snpdata.coding()
	Added stepwise model selection stepup.moments2()
	Added approximation for logistic regression gls.approx.logistic()
	Added simulated example dataset mthfrex
	Many edits and improvements to documentation
	Fixed many warnings and errors identified by R CMD check

Version 0.0.3 (2011 Nov 16) first submission to CRAN
	Edits and improvements to documentation to pass R CMD check with no warnings
	Most functions now have an example in the documentation
	All read.snpdata.*() functions now return an object of class "snpdata"
	Added is.snpdata() and as.snpdata() functions and summary.snpdata() method
TO DO	Functions expecting a snpdata argument check using stopifnot(is.snpdata(...))
TO DO	make.moments2 now returns an object of class "moments2"
TO DO	Added is.moments2() and as.moments2() functions and summary.moments2() method
TO DO	Functions expecting an xtx argument check using stopifnot(is.moments2(...))
	Added stepdown.moments2()

Version 0.0.4 (2011 Nov)
	In align.snpdata.coding(), removed useless stopifnot()s, and
	corrected value used (when ploidy!=2) in dosage upper range check and
	denominator for calculating params$data.coded.freq

	In gls.approx.logistic(), fixed stopifnot() to allow missing
	values leftvar, forced intercept into model, made default
	rightvars=NULL, added outvar and weightvar arguments

	make.moments2 now returns an object of class "moments2" with
	attribute "vscale" set to NULL or 1 if unweighted or weighted
	respectively

	Added is.moments2()

	est.moments2 checks "vscale" attribute of xtwx argument and uses
	this instead of function argument (with warning if different), and
	checks vscale==NULL before inferring n from xtwx["ONE","ONE"]

version 0.0.5 (2012 March)

	Added tools to help BLAT SNP or mutation sequences:
	sanitise.whitespace(), getSNP(), remap.q2t()

	Added multipheno.T2() for tests of association with >1 phenotype
	Added abf.* for approximate Bayes factors, as used for Johnson et
		al. 2011 AJHG paper

version 0.0.6 (2012 September)

	Added dsuffix and isuffix arguments to read.snpdata.mach
	Added wrapper function read.snpdata.minimac
	Added snphwe wrapper for Wiggington et al. code

version 0.0.7 (2012 September)
	Fixed gtx-package.Rd to be proper package documentation
	Made examples for fitmix* run faster by reducing number 
	       of iterations and restarts
